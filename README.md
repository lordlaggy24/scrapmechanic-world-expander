# scrapmechanic-world-expander WORKING

WARNING THIS IS AI CODE I DIDNT MAKE THIS
so if there any major bugs or issues I CAN NOT FIX IT 
this is just for fun ive finshed alot of survival worlds and had nothing to explore this will let u play a world for years
hopefully the reason why its not a custom game or steam workshop addon is beacause i didnt know how to and dont plan on doing it so if u want post this addon on the workshop all u want
i still want credit even know i didnt make it no one else is doing this for some reason

just makes worlds 5x bigger and 7x the amount of buildings over all its more interesting

after moving ur scripts folder u can replace it with the scripts folder inside the survivalworldexpander.zip move it into ur survial folder

if all done correct u should try making a new survival world and u should clearly see roads buildings ruins out on the edge of the map were it used to be just water now instead of a island u get a world
